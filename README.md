# Challenge 1 

## Description 
- At the start of the "Challenge 1" project a html file containing an abundance of div tags and little to no semantic html elements was inherited. In addition the css file linked to it was cluttered, repatative, and uneasy to follow. As a developer it was apparent that these issues could be rectified and a cleaner, more optimal code could be produced. 
- Adding HTML semantic elements benfits a webpage in several ways. Firstly, it provides additional informantion to a browser on the context of a webpage and its meaning. This then feeds into a webpages SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which can not only imporve the quantity of a webpages traffic, but also the quality. Secondly, semantic HTML is a key factor in encorporating good acessibility practices into a website. This means that users aided by screen readers or other assibility devices can also access a webpage. occasionally this can be very important in avoiding lawsuits. 
- On the other hand, the reordering of the css file was an improvment mainly targeted at other developers. If a developer was asked to fix a bug or change the webpage in the future they would have found the layout of the css file confusing and frustrating, as it was unordered and unnecessarily long.
- Throughout this project I expanded my knowledge of semantic HTML elements and gained a solid understanding of their importance. I also learned and applied the scout rule which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.
